# Fire Behavior Fundamentals

## The Fire Behavior Triangle

Wildfire behavior is controlled by three primary factors:

### 1. Fuels
- Type and arrangement of vegetation
- Moisture content
- Loading (tons per acre)
- Continuity (horizontal and vertical)

### 2. Weather  
- Wind speed and direction
- Temperature
- Relative humidity
- Atmospheric stability

### 3. Topography
- Slope steepness
- Aspect (direction slope faces)
- Elevation
- Terrain features (canyons, ridges)

## How These Factors Interact

The interaction between fuels, weather, and topography creates the specific fire behavior observed at any given time and location.

### Fuel-Weather Interactions
- Dry fuels + high winds = rapid spread
- High humidity = reduced fire activity
- Temperature affects fuel moisture

### Topography-Weather Interactions  
- Slope winds (upslope during day, downslope at night)
- Foehn/Chinook winds
- Valley inversions

### Fuel-Topography Interactions
- Aspect affects fuel moisture and type
- Elevation determines vegetation zones
- Slope position affects fuel loading
