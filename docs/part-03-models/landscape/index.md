# Landscape Fire Spread Models

## Overview

Landscape-scale models predict fire growth across heterogeneous terrain over hours to days.

## FARSITE

### Description
FARSITE (Fire Area Simulator) is the most widely used operational fire spread model in the United States.

### Key Features
- Deterministic fire growth simulation
- Rothermel-based spread equations
- Crown fire modeling
- Spotting algorithms

### Applications
- Operational fire planning
- Fuel treatment analysis
- Risk assessment

### Availability
- Free download from firelab.org
- Windows-based GUI
- Training through NWCG

## FlamMap

### Description
Analyzes fire behavior for constant weather conditions across a landscape.

### Key Features
- Minimum Travel Time algorithms
- Burn probability modeling
- Treatment optimization

## ELMFIRE

### Description
Eulerian Level set Model of FIRE spread - a modern alternative to FARSITE.

### Key Features
- Faster computation
- Better parallelization
- Monte Carlo capabilities
