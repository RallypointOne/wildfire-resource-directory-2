# Rothermel Fire Spread Model

## Overview
The Rothermel surface fire spread model (1972) is the foundation of most operational fire modeling in the United States.

## Key Equations
The basic spread rate equation:
- R = IR × ξ × (1 + φw + φs) / (ρb × ε × Qig)

## Applications
- Used in [[FARSITE]]
- Basis for [[BehavePlus]]
- Incorporated in [[FlamMap]]

## Strengths
✅ Widely validated
✅ Simple to implement
✅ Fast computation

## Limitations
❌ Limited to surface fire
❌ Empirical basis
❌ No fire-atmosphere coupling
